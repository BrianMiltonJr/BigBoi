Builds a Directory with it's contents into an Object and then Serializes it.


I made this to back up WoW Addon + config files. I know it should use registry (I had a version where it did, forgot to upload it),
at the time of writting this I had swapped over from Java so I implemented the way I searched for the WoW folder like I did in Java.
